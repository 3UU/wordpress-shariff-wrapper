# Shariff Wrapper

This is the development repository for the WordPress plugin Shariff Wrapper (https://wordpress.org/plugins/shariff/), which has been developed by Jan-Peter Lambeck (https://www.jplambeck.de) and 3UU (https://datenverwurstungszentrale.com).

To avoid confusion in the future developmet we will use the same directory
structure as with WP svn repository now.

/trunk/ = The actual developmet version
/tag/x.x.x/ = x.x.x is the current "stable tag" used for upstream = same as in trunk/readme.txt * Version: x.x.x
/assets/ = Files used on the wordpress.org plugin page.  

license.txt = The license file (MIT).  
readme.md = This file.  
shariff-example-service.php = Example file for new services.
